    <div class="video-title">2018: Turkish Music To Jazz</div>
    <div class="video-description">Worked on the development of the Turkish Language to Jazz Music project for one of the biggest banks in Turkey, Akbank. What this project achieves is that it takes a text in Turkish language as input. The text is analyzed linguistically and turned into a rhythmical structure, which in turn is turned into randomly generated jazz tune using some configurable parameters and rules. My role: Development of the language parsing and music generation methods. Used technologies: JS/Node.js, midi generation plugins & samples</div>
